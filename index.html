                    Chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI), diabetes and
                    major lower limb amputations have been in the headlines in
                    Denmark. Vascular surgery has been a focus of attention
                    since an exposé on Danish national television on 11 May 2022
                    about variations in patient care. Almost every week there
                    have been headlines about patients who underwent unnecessary
                    leg amputations, or patients who narrowly avoided losing
                    their leg after seeking a second opinion. From existing in
                    relative obscurity, vascular surgery has been thrust into
                    the spotlight of Danish public attention.

                    What sparked the interest was an analysis of the status of
                    vascular surgery in the Central Region of Denmark, one of
                    the five political-administrative units governing the
                    tax-funded healthcare system in the country1. The report was
                    commissioned by the administrative leadership of the region.
                    In the report, a comparison was performed between the
                    Central Region of Denmark, with a population of 1,321,053
                    inhabitants (in 2019), and the rest of the peninsula of
                    Jutland, with a population of 1,349,771 inhabitants. The
                    number of infrainguinal revascularization procedures
                    (angioplasty or bypass surgery) performed for amputation
                    prevention in patients with CLTI performed in the Central
                    Region during the period 2007–2020 was 3151 versus 7069
                    procedures in the rest of Jutland. This number was stable
                    over the entire 14-year period. The number of major
                    amputations performed in the Central Region over the period
                    2016–2020 was reported to be 2013, while in the rest of
                    Jutland it was reported to be 1554, an annual difference of
                    92 amputations per year. Later, the Central Region corrected
                    the number they had provided for the analysis, changing the
                    number to an average difference of 47 amputations per year.
                  </p>
                  <p class="long-text">
                    This difference in amputation rates was publicly deemed to
                    be unacceptable by the political level of the Central
                    Region, by the Danish Minister of Health, and by politicians
                    from almost all political parties, all of whom demanded
                    action. One of the consequences was the firing of the
                    highest-ranking civil servant in the Central Region. A
                    broader analysis, including all of Denmark, has subsequently
                    been performed2, and hundreds of patients who have had a
                    limb amputated have received letters that they may be
                    eligible for financial compensation if their limb could have
                    been saved with more timely and appropriate vascular
                    intervention.

                    In the national report it was found that, between 2016 and
                    2021, three regions had increased their vascular surgical
                    activity and had seen a significant drop in amputation
                    rates2 (Fig. 1). However, one of these regions saw a much
                    larger reduction in the number of amputations than the two
                    others. In this region (the Northern Region), the increase
                    in the number of procedures had been combined with a
                    strengthening of orthopaedic services. This included a
                    regional single-entrance fast-track referral service of
                    patients for wound care, centred around a newly formed unit
                    of orthopaedic surgeons who were able to book their own
                    operating theatres and have regular multidisciplinary team
                    meetings with endocrinologists, vascular surgery
                    specialists, and interventional radiologists. These
                    observations highlight the need for timely revascularization
                    throughout the week, and was also recently illustrated in a
                    similar study in the UK that documented differences in
                    waiting time for revascularization, depending on the day of
                    admittance to hospital3.

                    variation, but in other cases the reasons for variation can
                    be more difficult to establish. A strong commitment to
